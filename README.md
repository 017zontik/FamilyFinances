I’ve finished the Java developer course and created this project.I’m going to continue work on this project and make it better and more comfortable.
This project is interested to analyze and regulation the family budget.
User can add accounts, create transactions by income or expense money and see the final balance.
I also have plans to add an opportunity to use different currencies and reports.
